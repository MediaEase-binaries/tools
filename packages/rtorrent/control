Description: ncurses BitTorrent client based on LibTorrent from rakshasa
  rtorrent is a BitTorrent client based on LibTorrent.  It uses ncurses
  and aims to be a lean, yet powerful BitTorrent client, with features
  similar to the most complex graphical clients.
  .
  Since it is a terminal application, it can be used with the "screen"/"dtach"
  utility so that the user can conveniently logout from the system while keeping
  the file transfers active.
  .
  Some of the features of rtorrent include:
   * Use an URL or file path to add torrents at runtime
   * Stop/delete/resume torrents
   * Optionally loads/saves/deletes torrents automatically in a session
     directory
   * Safe fast resume support
   * Detailed information about peers and the torrent
   * Support for distributed hash tables (DHT)
   * Support for peer-exchange (PEX)
   * Support for initial seeding (Superseeding)
  .
  This build includes :
   * libtorrent (= @LIBTORRENT_VERSION@)
   * @TINY_OR_XMLRPC@, 
   * mktorrent (= @MKTORRENT_VERSION@), 
   * libudns (= @LIBUDNS_VERSION@),
   * dumptorrent (= @DUMPTORRENT_VERSION@).
  .
